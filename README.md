Spotted tail
===

The graph for article dashboard.

## Requirements

* handle variable number line charts
* accept "impact events" and basic annotations
	* an "impact event" is a moment such as award
	* basic annotation is some relevante event such "this is when our main account tweeted the story" but that is not itself a measure of impact
* labels on impact events and annotations display nicely, i.e. avoid one another.
